My train pulled in to Waterloo
found myself wisin’ you were here with me
In London
Standin’ on the river Thames takin’ photographs
of Parliament and old Big Ben is ringin’
You know, it’s everything that I imagined it would be
I had no idea that it would feel so empty

Where are you tonight while I stand here and cry?
Watching double decker buses pass me by
And to tell you the truth, it’s all that I can do.
To keep from jumpin’ on a plane that's headed home
to you

I took a stroll down Abbey Road
tried to peek inside the studios
And somewhere along they way
I bought you flowers.
And a parking map of the underground
‘cause you and I both know I get turned around
I'm so lost without you
Though it’s everything that I imagined it would be
I had to idea that it would feel so empty

Where are you tonight while I stand here and cry?
Watching double decker buses pass me by
And to tell you the truth, it’s all that I can do.
To keep from jumpin’ on a plane that's headed home

Six long nights and seven days
across the pond back to the states I can’t wait

Where are you tonight while I stand here and cry?
Watching all the black umbrellas pass me by
To tell you the truth, it’s all that I can do.
To keep from jumpin’ on a plane that's headed home
So I’m jumpin’ on a plane, headed home. To you
