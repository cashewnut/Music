There's a force stronger than us
But this love I can't ignore (can't ignore)
We run the same course
But we never touch, my body attracts yours (attracts yours)

What if I am your missing piece
What if we mess with destiny
What if the definition of we
Is two people in time living their own lives

Like two parallel lines
That'll never, that'll never collide
Steady, I just keep on hoping
That one of us will find
Find a way we can intertwine
Steady I just keep, I keep on hoping

I keep on hoping

Another day
I see you runnin' away from the way that you look at me
Just look at me, yeah
Why you don't change?
Just cause the weather is cold, that don't mean that we're losing it (losing it)
Aren't you wondering

What if I'm your missing piece
What if we mess with destiny
What if the definition of we
Is two people in time living their own life

Like two parallel lines (two parallel lines)
That'll never, that'll never collide (never)
Steady, I just keep on hoping
That one of us will find (one of us will find)
Find a way we can intertwine
Steady I just keep, I keep on hoping

I keep on hoping

Like two parallel lines (two parallel lines)
That'll never, that'll never collide (never)
Steady, I just keep on hoping
That one of us will find (one of us will find)
Find a way we can intertwine
Steady I just keep, I keep on hoping

I keep on hoping

Like two parallel lines
That'll never, that'll never collide
Steady, I just keep on hoping (keep on hoping)
That one of us will find (parallel lines)
Find a way we can intertwine
Steady, I just keep (I keep on hoping)

Like two parallel lines
That'll never, that'll never collide
Steady, I just keep on hoping
