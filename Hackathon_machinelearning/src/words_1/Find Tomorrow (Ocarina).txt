Find Tomorrow (Ocarina)- Dimitri Vegas / Like Mike

Take me to a place where time is frozen
You don't have to close your eyes to dream

You can find escape inside this moment
And I will follow
I will follow
I believe our love can take us higher
Please don't ever bring me back to earth

I know I'm never lost
When you are near me
We'll find tomorrow
Find tomorrow

Don't you cry
Take your time
Let the world wait forever

Morning light will be our guide
As long as we stay together
We can find tomorrow

We can find tomorrow-ow-ow-ow
We can find tomorrow

We can find tomorrow-ow-ow-ow

We can find tomorrow
