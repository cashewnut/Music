Rush Of Fools - Never Far Away


Another mile down the road
Another mile from my home
Sometimes I feel quite alone as you know
As you know all there is to know

So hold my heart
As it's breaking apart
And I'll
I'll hold yours in mine

Oh Oh You're never far away
Oh Oh You're never far away
Oh Oh You're never far away from me

I close my eyes and try to see
See you right in front of me
As if you're only in my dreams
But you are
Everywhere and in between

You're the moonlight
In the dark of my night
And you
Shine bright so I can see

Oh Oh You're never far away
Oh Oh You're never far away
Oh Oh You're never far away from me

Catch my tears as they fall
It's like I never left at all
And all the world feels so small
Cuz right now
We are high above it all

Hold me close
Don't ever let me go
Tell me
What I already know

Oh Oh You're never far away
Oh Oh You're never far away
Oh Oh You're never far away from me

Oh Oh You're never far away
Oh Oh You're never far away
Oh Oh You're never far away from me
