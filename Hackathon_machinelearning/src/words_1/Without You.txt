Sometimes I try to keep myself out there
Sometimes I try to make it look
Like I'm comfortable in the skin I wear
But these words cut deeper than the knife
And I gotta act like I don't care
But if it didn't happen then I guess I wouldn't be here
I guess I wouldn't be here, oh no

Stop with all the bullshit
I'm done with all the fake love
So you should really just quit
'Cause I saw the texts on on your phone
And it's hard to say
It's hard to say
So I guess I'll be on my way

But I don't wanna live in a world without you
No, I don't wanna live in a world without you
No, I don't wanna live in a world without you
Noo-ooh, noo-ooh
No, I don't wanna live in a world without you

Silly for me to think you're the one I'd never blame
The one that I would never change
The one that always stays the same
Now I'm in the corner thinking back on all these memories
Like what I'd do if you had stayed
And all the lies that you betrayed
If time stood still
And I could see you again
Then I would keep you with me, yeah

Because I don't wanna live in a world without you
No, I don't wanna live in a world without you
No, I don't wanna live in a world without you
Noo-ooh, noo-ooh
No, I don't wanna live in a world without you
