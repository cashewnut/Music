I'll fill you up with bones that can never break
 Take you to a darker shade of grey
 Warm you like a sun that'll never fade
 Oooh, ooh

 This is power, this is power
 This is power, this is power, power, power
 This is power, this is power
 This is power, this is power, power, power

 I'll give you every heart of a hundred souls
 You can be the fire to kill the cold
 I'll break you like a rock that could never hold
 Oooh, ooh

 This is power, this is power
 This is power, this is power, power, power

 Power

 Power

 This is power, this is power
 This is power, this is power, power, power
