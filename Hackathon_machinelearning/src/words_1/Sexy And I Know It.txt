When I walk on by' girls be looking like damn he fly
I pay to the beat' walking on
the street with in my new lafreak' yeah
This is how I roll' animal print' pants out control'
It's real fool with the big F O
They like Bruce Lee rock at the club

Girl look at that body Girl look at that body
Girl look at that body I work out
Girl look at that body Girl look at that body
Girl look at that body I work out

When I walk in the spot' this is what I see
Everybody stops and they staring at me
I got passion in my pants and I ain't afraid to show it

I'm sexy and I know it

I'm sexy and I know it

When I'm at the moss' purity just can't fight them up
When I'm at the beach'
I'm in a speedo trying to tan my cheeks
This is how I roll' come on ladies it's time to go
We hit it to the bar' baby don't be nervous
No shows' no shirt' and I still get serviced

Girl look at that body Girl look at that body
Girl look at that body I work out
Girl look at that body Girl look at that body
Girl look at that body I work out

When I walk in the spot' this is what I see
Everybody stops and they staring at me
I got passion in my pants and I ain't afraid to show it

I'm sexy and I know it

I'm sexy and I know it...

I'm sexy and I know it

Girl look at that body Girl look at that body
Girl look at that body I work out
Girl look at that body Girl look at that body
Girl look at that body I work out
