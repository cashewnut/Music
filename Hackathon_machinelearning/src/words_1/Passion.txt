Blow my mind, blow my mind
Blow my mind, blow my
I found a potion
For fixing passion
Go tell your homegirls
Get their reaction
Out on the ocean
Her satisfaction
Go tell your homegirls
What's their reaction
You've got a little you could use much more
Pa Pa Pa Passion
Pa Pa Pa Passion
Blow my mind (blow my mind)
Pa Pa Pa Passion
Pa Pa Pa Passion
Blow my mind (blow my mind)
Blow my mind (blow)
I got a potion
It fixes passion
Don't leave me floating
Out of the action
I'm sorry happy
Belated birthday
Go tell the whole world
Wonder what they'll say
You've got a little you could use much more
Pa Pa Pa Passion
Pa Pa Pa Passion
Blow my mind (blow my mind)
Pa Pa Pa Passion
Pa Pa Pa Passion
Blow my mind (blow my mind)
Pa Pa Pa Pa Pa Pa
Pa Pa Pa Pa Pa Pa
Go! Go!
Pa Pa Pa Please good god would you blow my mind
Blow my mind (blow my mind)
Please good god would you blow my mind
Blow my mind (blow my mind)
Blow my mind, blow my mind
Blow my mind, blow my mind
Passion
Passion
I need it (passion)
Passion
