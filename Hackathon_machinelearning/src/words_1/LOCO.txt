Everybody loco
Are you with me?
Don't know what it is
But I'm lovin' it
And it's making me
Making me go loco
What we're doing now
Get me zoom in & out
Everybody now
Everybody loco

Lo lo lo loco
Go go go
Everybody loco
Go go
Loco~ ha ha
It's the way you move
It's the dance you do
Baby look at you
Make me go loco
Can't forget you now
Gonna cool me down
Wanna screamin' out
Everybody loco

Oh oh there you go (there you go)
It's not the rule
I didn't choose
Pick me a phone (make me go loco)
Wo we're just in love (We're just in love)
That's all I took
We're just in love
You have me shot

Lo lo lo loco
Go
Makin' me go loco
Go
Makin' me go loco
Oh there you go (there you go)
It's not the rule
I didn't choose
Pick me a phone (everybody loco)
Making' me loco
