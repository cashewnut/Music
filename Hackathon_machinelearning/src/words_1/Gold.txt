The feelings that I leave you with
Will I be thinking I'm a ghost in your bed?
I'm sure by now your feeling so low
Looking at our photos, wishing you and I still there

And I'm sorry that I'm like this
It's not your fault that I was messed up before
That's why I'm leaving so fast
When you blink, I'll be gone out the door

Cause, yeah, I steal your heart of gold
You feel it come and go
Leave you high and low, so low
Yeah, I steal heart of gold
It's gone before you know
Leave you high and low, so low, low, low

Why'd you go and labeled this?
When from the start I told you not to do that shit
And now these expectations feeling suffocated
You knew it would end like this

And I'm sorry that I'm like this
It's not your fault that I was messed up before
That's why I'm leaving so fast
When you blink, I'll be gone out the door, out the door

Cause, yeah, I steal your heart of gold
You feel it come and go
Leave you high and low, so low
Yeah, I steal heart of gold
It's gone before you know
Leave you high and low, so low, low, low

And I'm sorry that I'm like this
It's not your fault, it's not your fault
Yeah, I'm sorry that I'm like this
It's not your fault, no, it's not your fault

And I'm sorry that I'm like this
It's not your fault that I was messed up before
That's why I'm leaving so fast
When you blink, I'll be gone out the door

Cause, yeah, I steal your heart of gold
You feel it come and go
Leave you high and low, so low
Yeah, I steal heart of gold
It's gone before you know
Leave you high and low, so low, low, low
