I'm going on
Nothing feels like home
I'm so alone
Try to find my way back home to you
I'm so alone
Nothing feels like home
I'm so alone
Try to find my way back home to you
I'm so alone
Try to find my way back home to you
I'm so alone
Nothing feels like home
I'm so alone
Try to find my way back home to you
I'm going on
Nothing feels like home
I'm so alone
Try to find my way back home to you
I'm so alone
Try to find my way back home to you
