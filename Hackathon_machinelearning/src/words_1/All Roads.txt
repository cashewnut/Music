So many lonely nights I wake up from a dream
And wipe the sleep out of my eyes
From the center of the earth they’re pulling me
Waves of love I can’t describe…
And the days go by so slowly when you’re not around
And girl I need you now it’s been too long
And the seconds feel like centuries every time I go
but girl I always know where I belong
CHORUS
Baby I would drive all night to see your smilin’ face
Don’t you know our love keeps me pushing through
Baby I could find myself a million miles away
Don’t you know all roads lead me back to you
In my life there have been many twists of fate
There’s no crystal ball to see
But in my mind love I can hear our children play
And wonder what the future brings
Cos as long as I hold on my heart won’t let me down,
My feet won’t touch the ground
I’m on my way
To the place I’ve always known would be my only home
In your loving arms
Where I belong
Baby I would drive all night to see your smilin’ face
Don’t you know our love keeps me pushing through
Baby I could find myself a million miles away
Don’t you know all roads lead me back to you

as long as I hold on my heart won’t let me down,
My feet won’t touch the ground
I’m on my way
Baby I would drive all night to see your smilin’ face
Don’t you know our love keeps me pushing through
Baby I could find myself a million miles away
Don’t you know all roads lead me back to you
