Never a question of missed opportunities
I know that I should be letting you do this to me
Just let go
Can’t choose the time and you can’t choose the distances
Rounding the bend of familiar instances
Just let go
So I sit upon the wall
And I hear you when you call
Never been so hard
She is on her guard
Let go
Try to explain to yourself why you feel like this
You know the bow and the arrow can always miss
Just let go
This time there’s no way of hiding the way you feel
Ring out the bells, let them ring out and then appeal
Just let go
So I sit upon the wall
And I hear you when you call
Never been so hard
She is on her guard
Let go
Try so hard to just let go
Try so hard to just let go
Never a question of missed opportunities
I know that you know that I should be doing this
Just let go
