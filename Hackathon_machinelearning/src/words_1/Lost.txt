Can't find the light in the middle of the night
Can't feel my feet when the river runs deep
I close my eyes a thousand times and all I see is you

I'm flying high, it's do or die
I wanna feel the fall, I wanna lose control
It's black as white, so wrong it's right
I do it to myself

If I had to get lost to find you
I would lose myself again
If I had to get lost to find you
I would lose myself again
If I had to get lost to find you
I would lose myself again
If I had to get lost to find you
I would lose myself again

If I had to get
If I had to get

I feel the pleasure hidden in the pain
I feel the sunlight, fall through the rain
But I search for you
But I search for you
Time, time again

I'm flying high, it's do or die
I wanna feel the fall, I wanna lose control
It's black as white, so wrong it's right
I do it to myself

If I had to get lost to find you
I would lose myself again
If I had to get lost to find you
I would lose myself again

If I had to get

If I had to get lost to find you
I would lose myself again
If I had to get lost to find you
I would lose myself again

If I had to get
