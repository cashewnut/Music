作曲 : ROBERT SWIRE THOMPSON/GARETH MCGRILLEN
Come now, surely we can be friends?
I know so much about you
I love you, look at everything I've done for you
You would be nothing without me
Why won't you answer me?
I bet you're busy talking to some fucking slut
Fucking skank
Is she hotter than me?
Would you fuck me?
Are you gay?
You blocked me on Facebook
And now you're going to die
Now you're going to die
You blocked me on Facebook
And now you're going to die
Now you're going to die
You blocked me on Facebook
