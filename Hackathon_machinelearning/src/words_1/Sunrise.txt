Wake me up, my eyes are heavy
And I need some sun, one hit and I am ready
For whatever comes
Nothing can keep me from you
Nothing can keep me from you

Something about, the things you told me
Oh, I brought 'em down
Yeah, I took on with me to the place we found
And I'll be waiting for you
Yeah, I'll be waiting for you
For you

I follow the moon
From the dark to the break of dawn
We let it loose
Smoking weed and writing songs

Meet me at the sunrise, at the sunrise
I can get you so high, so high
Burning up the daylight, in the daylight
Meet me at the sunrise, sunrise

Called my name cause I'm so lost
And I don't know this place
And I got this feeling that I just can shake
Nothing can keep me from you
Nothing can keep me from you

I follow the moon
From the dark to the break of dawn
We let it loose
Smoking weed and writing songs

Meet me at the sunrise, at the sunrise
I can get you so high, so high
Burning up the daylight, in the daylight
Meet me at the sunrise, sunrise

Meet me at the sunrise, at the sunrise
I can get you so high, so high
Burning up the daylight, in the daylight
Meet me at the sunrise, sunrise
