I always have something to say
whether right or wrong
whether short or long
never I drowned on my town
I keep it moving fast
don’t mind the hour or glass
don’t mind the time running out
you know it catches my eyes
cause I have been waiting for it all of my life
and there is nothing I wouldn’t try
cause I have been waiting for it all of my life
closer that I get to the end
holding to a dream
it keeps me on my feet
footprints my heart just can claim
just a little told
but I’ll find that open door
you know for better or worse goal
it always catches my eyes
cause I have been waiting for it all of my life
and there is nothing I wouldn’t try
cause I have been waiting for it all of my life
and I’ll say oh~~~~ oh~~~~
it always catches my eyes
cause I have been waiting for it all of my life
and there is nothing I wouldn’t try
cause I have been waiting for it all of my life
and I’ll say oh~~~~ oh~~~~
you know it always catches my eyes
cause I have been waiting for it all of my life
