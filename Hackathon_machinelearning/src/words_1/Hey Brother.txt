Hey Brother! There's an endless road to rediscover
Hey Sister! Know the water's sweet but blood is thicker
Oh! When the sky comes falling down! For you
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do
Hey Brother! Do you still believe in one another?
Hey Sister! Do you still believe in love? I wonder
Oh! When the sky comes falling down! For you
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do
What if I'm far from home? Oh Brother, I will hear you call!
What if I lose it all? Oh Sister, I will help hang on!
Oh! When the sky comes falling down! For you
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do
Hey Brother! There's an endless road to rediscover

Oh! When the sky comes falling down! For you
