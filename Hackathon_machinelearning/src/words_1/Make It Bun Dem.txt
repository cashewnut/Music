Yuh  killin'the  floors  we  see  zion  mus'
They  kickin ’the  floor  nah  we  let  dah  moles  in,

The  Legend  lives  on
We  give  dem  it  hard,we  give  dem  it  strong
We  give  dem  it  rough,we  give  dem  it  long
We  give  dem  it  right  and  never  yet  wrong
Sweeter  the  victory,the  hotter  the  battle
The  bigger  the  cover  the  fatter  the  bottle
The  place  has  to  rattle  a  my  tabernacle  this
Rudeboy  bass,mash  up  da  place!
