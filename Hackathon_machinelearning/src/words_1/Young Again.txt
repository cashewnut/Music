Young Again - Hardwell

When i was a boy
I dreamed of a place in the sky
Playing in the fields
Battling with my shields
Bows made out of twine

I wish i could see this world again
Through those eyes
See the child in me
In my fantasy
Never growing old

Will we ever feel young again

Will we ever feel young again

Will we ever feel young again

We wanna feel young

We wanna feel young again

When i was a boy
I searched for a world that's unknown
All we have is fun
Everybody run until the sun goes down

I wish i could see this world again
Through those eyes
See the child in me
In my fantasy
Never growing old

Will we ever feel young again

Will we ever feel young again

Will we ever feel young again

We wanna feel young

We wanna feel young again
