作曲 : Marius Njølstad
I don't usually smoke
I don't usually drink this much
Now I'm totally broke and I missed Lesi Peso
And baby I swear
I don't know where my friends have gone
But I don't really care
Cuase I keep putting it on to your hand
Like your secret I can't tell anyone
And all a all a all about you put me goals
To you sharing shadows and I think they know
And all a all a all about you
Casue you seems like magic
Just get to heaven
And all a all a all about you
Casue you feel like fairy
And I can happen
And all a all a all about you
I don't usually feel I don't usually feel this burst
But I think this is real
When we dance when we dance sunlight sunrise
Let's get out of this place
I don't know where I put my phone
But I know I'm OK
As long as I hold on to your hand
Like your secret I can't tell anyone
And all a all a all about you put me goals
To you sharing shadows and I'm thinking you know
And all a all a all about you
Casue you seems like magic
Just get to heaven
And all a all a all about you
Cuase you feel like fairy
And I can't happen
And all a all a all about you
'Bout
All about you
'Bout
And all a all a all about you
Hooo yeahhhh
And all a all a all about
You
I say all about you all about you
And all a all a all about you
Cuase you seems like magic
I just got to heaven
And all a all a all about you
Cause you feel like fairy
And I can't happen
And all a all a all about you
'Bout
All about you
About
And all a all a all about you
