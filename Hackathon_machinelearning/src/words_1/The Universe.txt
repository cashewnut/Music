In the beginning, there was darkness
The world give birth to an endless expanding system
Of time, space and matter
Now, see further than we've ever imagines
Beyond the limits of our exisistance
In a place we call
THE UNIVERSE
5, 4, 3, 2, 1
Fire!
There is an ever changing place
Where unexplained mysteries will continue to elude us
But we're edging ever closer to unlocking the keys to our past
And pathways to our future
There is still plenty, left to discover
About a place we call
THE UNIVERSE
5, 4, 3, 2, 1
Fire!
