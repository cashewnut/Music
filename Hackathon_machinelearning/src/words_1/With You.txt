Sitting at a bar with some friends
Telling them the things that you said
Left me with my heart in my hands
Told me we'd be better just friends
Staring at a television
Something 'bout the world's gonna end

I think about you, oh
You think about me too, oh

If we're losing our minds
I'll get lost with you
If we're all gonna die
I wanna die with you

I wanna die with you
I wanna die with you

I been seeing tears all morning
Feel like my apartment's flooding
I don't even know where we left it
Maybe I just need to take a shower
Washing off the last ten hours
All I smell is coffee and cigarettes and you

I'm thinking about you, oh
You think about me too, oh

If we're losing our minds
I get lost with you
If we're all gonna die
I wanna die with you

I wanna die with you
I wanna die with you

Thinking about you
If I losing in my minds
I get lost with you
If we're all gonna die
I wanna die with you

I wanna die with you
I wanna die with you
