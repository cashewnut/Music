This is our last goodbye, don't come and find me
So hard to the crowd, please, somebody blind me

Cause I can feel it, I'm still lagging onto every word
My heart is beating, and I'm sorry that I left you hurt

We were kids in love, and then we grew up
But won't you hold me close tonight like we're kids in love?
Kids in love, kids in love, kids in love

We were kids in love
We were kids in love

Engine on, million drive, running for hours
Slowly, we twist the knife in, folding like towers

And I can feel it, and we're running out of hope tonight
I hear you breathing as we're hanging on to you and I

We were kids in love, and then we grew up
But won't you hold me close tonight like we're kids in love?
Kids in love, kids in love, kids in love

Maybe I could cope if I could hold you
We were kids in love

One last time, one last time
And wherever you go, I'll just hold you forever
Maybe I could cope if I could hold you
We were kids in love
Kids in love, kids in love, kids in love
