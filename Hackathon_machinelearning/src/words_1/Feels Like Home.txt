Settled on that blood red carpet.
Everything I ever wanted.
Wonder if I’ll wake up
as you put on your makeup
and I sing songs about you from the bedroom.

Little hook and first verse started.
Different from the ones that carved it.
Fingers crossed, and toes, but
I won’t get my hopes up.
Just stick with what I know and what I’ve been through.

What if I’m a lost little face in the crowd?
What if I don’t often enough work it out?
Whoa-o-oh
Whoa-o-oh
Can you hear the crowd go…
Whoa-o-oh
Whoa-o-oh
Now I know it feels like home.

Through all the crazy things that happened
I’ve been working like a mad man.
I could use a rest though,
I just want to save those
hours up and use them when I need you.

What if I’m a lost little face in the crowd?
What if I don’t often enough work it out?
What if I don’t want this,
but it’s moving so fast
I can’t slow down.
Whoa-o-oh
Whoa-o-oh
Can you hear the crowd go…
Whoa-o-oh
Whoa-o-oh
Now I know it feels like home.
Lost in treble, beat, bass, tone.
Thought that I had lost it
but I found it rusted,
cleaned it up and brought it home.

For all the weight I carry on my shoulders,
it’s dragging me back down to earth…

Whoa-o-oh
Whoa-o-oh
Can you hear the crowd go…
Whoa-o-oh
Whoa-o-oh
Now I know it feels like home.
Lost in treble, beat, bass, tone.
Thought that I had lost it
but I found it rusted,
cleaned it up and brought it home.
