As the cheerless towns pass my window
I can see a washed out moon through the fog
And then a voice inside my head breaks the analogue
And says
"Follow me down to valley below “
You know
Moonlight is bleeding from out of your soul"
I survived against the will of my twisted folk
But in the deafness of my world the silence broke
And said
"Follow me down to valley below “
You know
Moonlight is bleeding from out of your soul"
"Follow me down to valley below ”
You know
Moonlight is bleeding from out of your soul
"My David don't you worry ”
This cold world is not for you
So rest your head upon me
I have strength to carry you"
(Ghosts of the twenties rising Golden summers just holding you) （20
"Follow me down to valley below ”
You know
Moonlight is bleeding from out of your soul
"Follow me down to valley below “
You know
Moonlight is bleeding from out of your soul
Come to us Lazarus
It's time for you to go"
It's time for you to go"
