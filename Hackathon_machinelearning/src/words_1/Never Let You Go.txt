作曲 : John Newman/Kyrre Gørvell-Dahll
 作词 : John Newman
Emotions like summer
Wait to a blue sky
And I turned to hold you
As we watched the sunrise
'Cause this is amazing
Running wild with you
My thoughts are hazy
This may be way too soon

But I will never let you go
Never let you go, at all
I will never let you go
Never let you go, at all

I'm so lost in these summer nights
So lost in your crystal light
And even when this night is day
I won't regret the words I'm saying

I will never let you go
Never let you go, at all
I will never let you go
Never let you go, at all

Through the longest of time, I will never let you go
(Never let you go, I'll never let you go)
If we fall up time a line, I will always keep her hold
(Never let you go, I'll never let you go)
Through the longest of time, I will never let you go
(Never let you go, I'll never let you go)
If we fall up time a line, I will always keep her hold

I will never let you go
Never let you go, at all
I will never let you go
Never let you go, at all
