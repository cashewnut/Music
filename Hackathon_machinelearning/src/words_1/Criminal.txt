Put your hands up where I can see
 Give back that heart you stole from me
 Guess you never knew my love was criminal

 It's late till you're hurt like a wounded soldier
 And she show no mercy
 For your blood she's thirsty

 Smelling the fuel when the night is over
 And she's not that evil
 She just like to take control

 For all the girls that you used to know
 For all the hearts that you took for broke
 Put away your running, ain't no one coming
 No one to save you from the fall
 She said

 Put your hands up where I can see
 Give back that heart you stole from me
 Guess you never knew my love was criminal
 Give it all up 'cause there's no use
 What you've done comes back to you
 Guess you never knew this love was criminal

 Pray for the sins of the ones before ya
 And she show no mercy
 For your blood she thirsty
 But don't let a tainted heart destroy ya
 No, she not that evil
 She just like to take control

 For all the girls that you used to know
 For all the hearts that you took for broke
 Put away your running, it ain't no one coming
 No one to save you from the fall
 She said

 Put your hands up where I can see
 Give back that heart you stole from me
 Guess you never knew my love was criminal
 Give it all up 'cause there's no use
 What you've done comes back to you
 Guess you never knew this love was criminal

 My body, my body, my body, my body
 It bends and breaks
 Yet you still love to turn you on
 Your body, your body, your body, your body
 You miss my kisses
 Send you back to get this gone
 She said

 Put your hands up where I can see
 You'd like to hide yourself from me
 Guess you never knew my love was criminal
 Give it all up 'cause there's no use
 What you've done comes back to you
 Guess you never knew this love was criminal

 This love is criminal
 Ain't not forgiving
 This love is, this love is
 This love is criminal
 This love is criminal
 Ain't not forgiving
 This love is, this love is
 This love is criminal
