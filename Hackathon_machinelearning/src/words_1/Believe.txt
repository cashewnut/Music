And I could learn to love her,
And if we could be I would not treat her like another,
No, cause times like theses well I'm begging our dreams,
And its times like those are thrown away.
And i believe, in the stars
They fill the hole inside my heart,
And I believe, in her life,
Like a candle oh so bright
I'm not just supernatualistic, artificial cup of tea
But I believe in you.
And I will find the answer
Ill search high and low
Just to write another lonely song about her
Cause times like these we see the fading autumn leaves,
And it times like those are thrown away, yeah yeah
And I believe, in the stars
They fill the hole inside my heart,
And I believe, in her life, like a candle oh so bright I'm not just supernatualistic artificial cup of tea
But I believe in you.
Yeah, but I don't know what is about her love,
Will she drive me up the wall?
Inside and out I'm losing touch; I'm just a dreaming boy that's all I ever wanted to be.
And I believe, in the stars
They fill the hole inside my heart,
And I believe, in her life,
Like a candle oh so bright
I'm not just supernatualistic, artificial cup of tea
But I believe and I believe
I believe in you
Do you believe in me?
