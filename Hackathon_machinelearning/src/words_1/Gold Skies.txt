See the smoke when the sun shines
We will forever be faded under gold skies
Captivated in your cold eyes
We will forever be faded under gold skies
See the smoke when the sun shines
We will forever be faded under gold skies
Captivated in your cold eyes
We will forever be faded under gold skies
See the smoke when the sun shines
We will forever be faded under gold skies
Captivated in your cold eyes
We will forever be faded under gold skies

Just the sun, feel me now, we will live forever

Just the sun, feel me now, we will live forever

Just the sun, feel me now, we will live forever

Just the sun, feel me now, we will live forever
Coming up, coming up
Coming up, coming up
Coming up, coming up
Coming up, coming up
Coming up, coming up
We will forever be faded under gold skies
Coming up, coming down, look at all this love we found
Just the sun, feel me now, we will live forever
