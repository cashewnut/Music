As I'm standing here, staring into the mirror
See the figure of a man trying to take a stand
And live for something more
Integrity is what I need and honor to my soul I feed
To give it up, pack it in, getting rid of all my sin that's weighing me down
Won't You come and fill
I want You to come and make me more real
Take this life, won't You change this life
Come and make me whole
Won't You take this life, won't You change this life
Won't You come and make me whole

In my pursuit of what is real
My heart is longing with a need to feel my soul come alive
I trudge and I step through the height and the death
Of a long narrow as I'm growing old
And soon I will be home
Won't You come and fill
So I want You to come and make me more real
Take this life, won't You change this life
Come and make me whole
Won't You take this life, won't You change this life
Won't You come and make me whole
Won't You take this life, won't You change this life
Won't You come and make me whole

As I'm standing here, staring into the mirror
See the figure of a man trying to take a stand
And live for something more
Integrity is what I need and honor to my soul I feed
To give it up, pack it in, getting rid of all my sin that's weighing me down
Take this life, won't You change this life
Won't You come and make me whole
Won't You take this life, won't You change this life
Won't You come and make me whole
Won't You take this life, won't You change this life
Won't You come and make me whole
Won't You take this life, won't You change this life
Won't You come and make me whole
Come and make me whole
