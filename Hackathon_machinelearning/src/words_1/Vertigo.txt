作曲 : Scott Effman/Caroline Pennell
My body's a vertigo
I can't turn it off
Head spinning when I get you close
I can't make it stop
Couple bottles and a radio
I'm so into you
So what you wanna do?
You got room for two?

Before it gets colder
Before it's too late
The party is over
Head on my shoulders, hands on my waist
Before we're too dizzy
You tell me to stay
I'm not trying to leave
And I'm not trying to sleep

Body's speaking, show me what it means
Is this real or fantasy?
Is this real or fantasy?
Am I dreaming?
I don't wanna know
When I'm in your vertigo
When I'm in your vertigo

When I'm in your vertigo

Head swimming in chemicals
Sinking in your bed
Sky's silver but we're seeing gold
Hard to get in bed
Couple bottles and a radio
I'm so into you
So what you wanna do?
You got room for two?

Before it gets colder
Before it's too late
The party is over
Head on my shoulders, hands on my waist
Before we're too dizzy
You tell me to stay
I'm not trying to leave
And I'm not trying to sleep

Body's speaking, show me what it means
Is this real or fantasy?
Is this real or fantasy?
Am I dreaming?
I don't wanna know
When I'm in your vertigo
When I'm in your vertigo

When I'm in your vertigo
When I'm in your vertigo
