Oh, I wanna know, wanna know
If you were up in there, anywhere
Cause all that I know, that I know
Wanna take a look at you and stop and stare
Cause you were like I've never seen
I'm lost between the clouds
Trying to find my way back down
For you the best of all there's now
Cause now is what we need the most
Now is what we need the most
Now is what we need the most
Cause now is what we need the most
Cause now is what we need the most
If you go deep, than you've tasted high
If you don't seek, you will never find
Cause now is what we need the most
Cause now is what we need the most
Cause now is what we need the most
