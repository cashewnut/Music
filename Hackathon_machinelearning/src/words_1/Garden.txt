Some say there are better days
Some think there are different ways
Wise men don’t believe in roses
This world has so many lies
They’ve made me realize
That the fruits are hanging on the trees in my garden
So you know where I’ll go
When I can’t handle all the Things in the world
A good show calypso’s singing
I don’t waste a minute
People go wherever they go
I’ve lost control so long ago
But now
I’ll have a drink in my garden
People do whatever they do
I’m sorry for my pessimist view
But you
You can stay in my garden
In 91 you shot a gun
In 94 there was a war
While the snails were slowly creeping in my garden
In 97 I fell out of my heaven
In 98 I chose your fate
In 99 I felt so fine
Cuz I didn’t care about the sign of the times
People go wherever they go
I’ve lost control so long ago
But now
I’ll have a drink in my garden
People do whatever they do
I’m sorry for my pessimist view
But you
You can stay in my garden
Together we'll be whistling

So you know
Where I'll go
When I can't handle all the things in the world
A good show Calypso's singing
I don't waste a minute
People go wherever they go
I've lost control so long ago
But now
I'll have a drink in my garden
People do whatever they do
I'm sorry for my pessimist view
But you
You can stay in my garden
And everybody's singing
