And when the sun goes down
That's when I need you most
And when you're not around
That's when I need you most
And when I'm coming down
That's when I need you most
And when I let you down
That's when I need you most

And when the sun goes down
That's when I need you most
And when you're not around
That's when I need you most
And when I'm coming down
That's when I need you most
And when I let you down

'Cause you know I've been fucking around
Oh, darling sweet baby, we had it all
But right, now (right now)
(That's when I need you most)
That's when I need you most
(That's when I need you most)
That's when I need you most
(That's when I need you most)
That's when I need you most
(That's when I need you most)
That's when I need you most
(That's when I need you most)
That's when I need you most
(That's when I need you most)

And when the sun goes down
That's when I need you most
And when you're not around
That's when I need you most
And when I'm coming down
That's when I need you most
And when I let you down
That's when I need you most

And when the sun goes down
That's when I need you most
And when you're not around
That's when I need you most
And when I'm coming down
That's when I need you most
And when I let you down

'Cause you know I've been fucking around
Oh, darling sweet baby, we had it all
But right, now (right now)

That's when I need you most
(That's when I need you most)
That's when I need you most
(That's when I need you most)
That's when I need you most
(That's when I need you most)
That's when I need you most

And when the sun goes down
That's when I need you most
And when you're not around
That's when I need you most
And when I'm coming down
That's when I need you most
And when I let you down
That's when I need you most
