Tell me, tell me that you want me
And I'll be yours completely, for better or for worse
I know, we'll have our disagreements
Be fighting for no reason, I wouldn't change it for the world
Cause I knew, the first day that I met you
I was never gonna let you, let you slip away
And I still remember feeling nervous
Trying to find the words to get you here today
You make my heart feel like its summer
When the rain is pouring down
You make my whole world feel so right when it's wrong
That's how I know that you are the one
That's why I know you are the one
Life is easy to be scared of
With you I am prepared for what is yet to come
Cause our two hearts will make it easy
Joining up the pieces, together making one
You make my heart feel like its summer
When the rain is pouring down
You make my whole world feel so right when it's wrong
That's how I know you are the one
That's why I know you are the one
When we are together you make me feel like my mind is free
And my dreams are reachable
You know I never ever believed in love or believed one day
That you would come along
Free me
You make my heart feel like its summer
When the rain is pouring down
You make my whole world feel so right when its wrong
That's why I know you are the one
That's why I know you are the one
That's why I know that you are the one
That's how I know you are the one
