"I'll Think Of You"
I’ll think of you as I go
So when I leave you’re not alone
No matter where you are
We will never be that far
Cause I will think of you as I go
I’ll think of you As I dream
So when it’s dark
You’ll be with me
And no matter where you are
We can look up to the star
And I’ will think of you as I dream
Oh it’s a long and winding road
But you don’t have to walk alone
Cause no matter where we are
I will keep you in my heart
And I will think of you as I go
Oh it’s a long and winding road
But you don’t have to walk alone
Cause no matter where we are
I will keep you in my heart
And I will think of you as I go
Yes I will think of you as I go
