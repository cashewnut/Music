Can we have a good time?
Can we have a good time?
Can we have a good time?
Can we have a good time?
Can we have a good time?

Just me and you, you should be my boo
Can we have a good time?
Girl, you are my type, me and you the hype
Can we have a good time?
We should rock Chanel, girl, I love your smell
Can we have a good time? A good time?

I'ma call you a ride
Tell me when it's outside
Tell me when it's outside
I'ma call you a ride
Tell me when it's outside
Tell me when it's outside
We just smoked too much
She said she liked my sound
And this girl too wet
I think I might just drown

So what? So what?
Turn up, turn up
I don't wanna drink too much
Turn up, turn up
So what? So what?
Told her we ain't gotta run
If you promise me all your time
VVS diamonds, we gon' shine

Can we have a good time?
Can we have a good time?
Can we have a good time?
Can we have a good time?
Can we have a good time?

Just me and you, you should be my boo
Can we have a good time?
Girl, you are my type, me and you the hype
Can we have a good time?
We should rock Chanel, girl, I love your smell
Can we have a good time? A good time?

I just wanna spend money
I just wanna spend money
Throw it all on you
I just wanna spend money
I just wanna spend money
Pour it all on you
She be fuckin' with the cocaine
I'd be rolling up the propane
We could really run it up
All the flights, they be private
"Twenty, take me to the islands"
That's all she say

So what? So what?
Turn up, turn up
I don't wanna drink too much
Turn up, turn up
So what? So what?
Told her we ain't gotta run
If you promise me all your time
VVS diamonds, we gon' shine

Can we have a good time?
Can we have a good time?
Can we have a good time?
Can we have a good time?
Can we have a good time?

Just me and you, you should be my boo
Can we have a good time?
Girl, you are my type, me and you the hype
Can we have a good time?
We should rock Chanel, girl, I love your smell
Can we have a good time? 24hrs

Can we have a good time?
