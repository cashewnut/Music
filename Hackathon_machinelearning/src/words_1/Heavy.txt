When did we get so lost inside ourselves?
 We used to be strong, now it's like we don't care
 Instead we're calling out for help
 Don't know where we went wrong, but it's so hard to share
 (So hard to share)

 All this weight left on our shoulders
 Too much for the both of us

 When did it get so heavy?
 This love that's in between us
 It never used to feel this
 Feels so heavy
 Can't get up off the ground
 It's weighing us down

 It's weighing us down
 When did we get so bad at being honest?
 You got things on your mind, that you don't wanna say
 Thought that we had made a promise
 That we would never get this way

 But all this weight left on our shoulders
 Too much for the both of us

 When did it get so heavy?
 This love that's in between us
 It never used to feel this
 Feels so heavy
 Can't get up off the ground(up off the ground)
 It's weighing us down

 It's weighing us down

 It's weighing us down
 (Heavy
 Can't get up off the ground
 It's weighing us down)
