When you're cold and you're broken
Like you're lost at the sea
Follow me in this moment
And be free
So don't look down you gotta wait
Don't worry now we can escape
When you don't know how to go alone
We're stronger now than on our own, oh
We could change the world tonight, oh tonight
If we are one
Cause we can change the dark to light, oh to light
If we are one
If we are one
When you're cold and you're broken
Like you're lost at the sea
Follow me in this moment
And be free
So don't look down you gotta wait
Don't worry now we can escape
When you don't know how to go alone
We're stronger now than on our own, oh
We could change the world tonight, oh tonight
If we are one
Cause we can change the dark to light, oh to light
If we are one
If we are one
If we are one
If we are one
