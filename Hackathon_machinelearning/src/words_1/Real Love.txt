You're feeling old and fattened like a soldier
Floating on a sea of gold.
Lightning striking, flies in blazes frightening
Hoping for nothing more
We'll face the weather, sail away together
We can make it mean more.
Astounding you found me, a lot of love surround me
There's no way I could ask for more
When you say what I said,
It's not the way I meant to say
I'm sorry, guess I chose the wrong way
To let you know I'm missing you to put your arms around me
I swear that this is real love
Real like love
Forever lovers will never loose each other
Will ride into the sun
The stars will follow, don't worry bout tomorrow
We'll all keep shining on
When you say what I said,
It's not the way I meant to say
I'm sorry, guess I chose the wrong way
To let you know I'm missing you to put your arms around me
I swear that this is real love
Real like love
Sometimes we drift apart,
But that's not who we are
We just need some kerosene to feed the fire
Slow down, just take it easy
Sometimes I can't believe it
It feels like fantasy that you are mine, yeah
you are mine, yeah
When you say what I said,
It's not the way I meant to say
I'm sorry, guess I chose the wrong way
To let you know I'm missing you to put your arms around me
I swear that this is real love
Real like love
I'm missing you to put your arms around me
I swear that this is real love
Real like love
