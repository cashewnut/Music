When the old soles have shoes are worn through
And it's too far to find a way home
You're feeling older than you used to
Can't stop thinking you'll be left alone

Don't you worry now
Don't let life get you down
Just remember you're mine

When I see you in the high and low
In the high and low, I have found you
And I see you anywhere you go
Anywhere you go, I've followed you anywhere

The sun is so cold, as you reach for
My oldest T-shirt to keep you warm
We'll never grow old, we'll never want more
This love will weather in the storm

Don't you worry now
Don't let life get you down
Just remember you're mine

When I see you in the high and low
In the high and low, I have found you
And I see you anywhere you go
Anywhere you go, I've followed you anywhere

When I see you in the high and low
In the high and low, I have found you
And I see you anywhere you go
Anywhere you go, I've followed you anywhere
