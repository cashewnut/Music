little girl looking at the ceiling
little girl how are you feeling
there's no shame in being alone
the tears you hide
behind your eyes
cry me out until they're gone
so I can hear your call
behind a a broke down wall
that you've been building for so long
so let it out
it feels good
to let the wait the doubt the hurt
the burn that you've withstood
but oh
I know you'll make it through
there's a host of angels watching over over you
over you
if I could I would lift your burden
cos I know how much you're hurtin
but I see you getting stronger
I wish you knew how
you make me proud
but i'm not the only one
so let it out
it feels good
to let the wait the doubt the hurt
the burn that you've withstood
but oh,
I know you'll make it through
there's a host of angels watching over over you
I know you'll make it through
there's a host of angels watching over over you
over you
in a mix of your despair
hope will find you
if you lost all your fear
angels will guide you
so let it out
it feels good
to let the wait the doubt the hurt
the burn that you've withstood
but oh,
I know you'll make it through
there's a host of angels watching over over you
but oh,
I know you'll make it through
there's a host of angels watching over over you
over you
