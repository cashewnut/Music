sure i can leave a light on
let it shine on
leave it till dawn
sure i can leave a light on
leave a light on for you
it takes two to find a way out
there is no doubt
i will be around
if you have lost the right track
then iâ€™ll lead you right back
don't search to find
don't smile just to be nice
don't run just to get there on time
be amazed
simply blown away
live on without
getting off your cloud
sure i can leave a light on
leave a light on for you
sure i can play a quiet song
i could just hum
beat a soft drum
sure i can play a quiet song
play a quiet song for you
it takes you to make my heart sing
to let air in
and keep breathing
it takes two to keep the vibe true
i am waiting for you
it struck me again
we both look the same
but what you make
appears in all shapes
i should impress
but nevertheless
i cannot change
night into a day
so sure i can leave a light on
leave a light on for you
