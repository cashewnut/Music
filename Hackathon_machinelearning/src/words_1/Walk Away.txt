I don't know why you're changing the vibe when it's perfectly right
And I can't understand why you hold me to promises that I never planned
If you're gonna worry about tomorrow
Then you're gonna miss today
If you're too hung up on the future
Then I might just walk away
Walk away (Walk away Walk away)
Just walk away (Just walk away)
(Just walk away Just walk away)
I don't know how to love you when I'm sober
If you want something more I guess it's over
If those are the all the words you've got to say
I just close the door and walk away
(Walk away Walk away)
I thought we were fine with no complications just sharing the night
And I can't understand why you hold me to promises I never planned
If you're gonna worry about tomorrow
Then you're gonna miss today
If you're too hung up on the future
Then I might just walk away
Walk away (Walk away Walk away)
Just walk away (Just walk away)
(Just walk away Just walk away)
I don't know how to love when I'm sober
If you want something more I guess it's over
If those are the all the words you've got to say
I just close the door and walk away
(Walk away Walk away)
(Walk away Walk away)
I just walk away
(I just close the door and walk away)
I just walk away
I just close the door and walk away
(Walk away Walk away)
(Just walk away Just walk away)
I just close the door and walk away
(Walk away Walk away)
(Just walk away Just walk away)
I just walk away
