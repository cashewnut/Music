I was just minding my business
Chasing around the dollars
I didn't even see the colors

You took me down like a landslide
Rumbling the city
I'm trembling, I'm dizzy

When you with me, you make me feel weak
You make me move to a (to a bizarre)
Feel my body heat, can get mostly
You make me move to a (to a bizarre)

You make me move
You make me move
Baby, make me move
Baby, move, baby make me move (to a bizarre)

Move, baby make me move (to a bizarre)

I can't help follow your rhythm
I'm along to your soul
Keeping it tide all day long

It feels good when I'm with him
Something about it kills me
Something about it thrills me

I'm in too deep, you make me feel weak
You make me move to a (to a bizarre)

Feel my body heat, can get mostly
You make me move to a (to a bizarre)

You make me move
You make me move
Baby, make me move
Baby, move, baby make me move (to a bizarre)

Move, baby make me move

Running through right my bloodstream
I feel it close to my skin
As like a mindblow wherever I go
I just wanna let you in

You make me move
You make me move
Baby, make me move
Baby, move, baby make me move (to a bizarre)

You make me move
You make me move
Baby, make me move
Baby, move, baby make me move (to a bizarre)

You make me move, baby make me move (to a bizarre)
