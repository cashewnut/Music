I can't really tell
What it feels on my skin
When you're whispering
All your intentions
I don't really know
Why my heart skips a beat
When you get too close
Always almost
Just like first love
You give everything
And you get too much
Just like first love
You don't really care if it hurts a lot
When it's all done
You look back and know it was worth it all
Worth it all
We'll never forget how it feels now
Just like first love
Just like first love
When it's all done
Just like first love
We're just making waves
Different shades of emotions
Fast and slow
Hot and cold
We bring out the worst
And the best in each other
But can't let go
Want so much
Just like first love
You give everything
And you get too much
Just like first love
You don't really care if it hurts a lot
When it's all done
We look back and know it was worth it all
Worth it all
We'll never forget how it feels now
Just like first love
Just like first love
When it's all done
Just like first love
Just like first love
I wanna get there I wanna get there I wanna
Just like first love
I gonna get there I gonna get there I gonna
When it's all done
I wanna get there I wanna get there I wanna
Just like first love
I gonna get there I gonna get there I gonna
I can't really tell
What it feels on my skin
When you get too close
Always almost
Just like first love
You give everything
And you get too much
Just like first love
You don't really care if it hurts a lot
When it's all done
You look back and know it was worth it all
Worth it all
We'll never forget how it feels now
Just like first love
I wanna get there I wanna get there I wanna
Just like first love
I gonna get there I gonna get there I gonna
When it's all done
I wanna get there I wanna get there I wanna
Just like first love
I gonna get there I gonna get there I gonna
Just like first love
