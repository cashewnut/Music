Where did you go
All the love's gonna keep you afloat
When the world is told
We'll be more as the fire that grows

Underwater
I'm gonna swim against the tide
Underwater
You couldn't drown me if you try

Underwater
I'll be breathing by your side

I'll be breathing by your side

Underwater
Underwater

Swim through a sea
Full of strangers found so deep
Spilling sparks and neon lights
As I give you the kiss of our life

Underwater
I'm gonna swim against the tide
Underwater
You couldn't drown me if you try

Underwater
I'll be breathing by your side
Breathing by your side
I'll be breathing by your side
Breathing by your side

Underwater
Underwater
