so go ahead and ask her
for happy ever after
cause nobody knows what’s coming
so why not take a chance on loving
come on, pour the glass and tempt me
either half-full or half-empty
cause if it all comes down to flavor
the glass is tipping in my favor
life gave me lemonade and i can’t imagine why
born on a sunny day, beneath a tangerine sky
i live life without pretending
i’m a sucker for happy endings
thanks for the lemonade
thanks for the lemonade!
now take your time to answer me
for the beauty of romancing
is to calm your trembling hand with mine
while begging love to fill your eyes
i can hardly breathe while waiting
to find out what your heart is saying
and as we’re swirling in this flavor
the world is tilting in our favor
life gave me lemonade and i can’t imagine why
born on a sunny day, beneath a tangerine sky
i live life without pretending
i’m a sucker for happy endings
thanks for the lemonade
thanks for the lemonade!
i’ve got it made rest in the shade
and hold my love while god above
stirs wiith a spoon
we share the moon
smile at the bees
more sugar please
he really loves us after all
we’re gonna need another straw!
we’re gonna need another straw!
coz life gave me lemonade and i can’t imagine why
born on a sunny day, beneath a tangerine sky
life gave me lemonade and i can’t imagine why
born on a sunny day, beneath a tangerine sky
i live life without pretending
i’m a sucker for happy endings
thanks for the lemonade
thanks for the lemonade!
thanks for the lemonade
thanks for the lemonade
