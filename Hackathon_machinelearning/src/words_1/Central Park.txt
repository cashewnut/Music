Staring down an endless avenue
There's sunlight sending out the end of June
Even in the crowds
I find I'm always looking out for you
One man band still playing by the lights
This time around something just don't feel right
Heart shaped bubble above my head
The things I should've said, you never knew
I'll make my way back to Central Park
Trace the pieces of my broken heart
I'm chasing down a fallen star to where you are
I'm held together by your memory
Baby won't you just come back to me?
I'll trace the pieces of my broken heart
Back to Central Park
You burn onto my mind like a tattoo
I'll shoot an arrow straight down 5th Avenue
The fortune teller said
"Let go of the rope and sail across theblue" â€œ
'll make my way back to Central Park
Trace the pieces of my broken heart
I'm chasing down a fallen star to where you are
I'm held together by your memory
Baby won't you just come back to me?
I'll trace the pieces of my broken heart
Back to Central Park
I got half that photograph
The Empire State above the stars
You still got yours, let's glue them backtogether
And let's stay here forever
I see you standing in a sea of sparks
We'll find our way back to the start
I'll make my way back to Central Park
Trace the pieces of my broken heart
Like I'm chasing down a fallen star to where you are
I'm held together by your memory
Baby won't you just come back to me?
I'll trace the pieces of my broken heart
Back to Central Park
I'll trace the pieces of my broken heart
Back to Central Park
I'll trace the pieces of my broken heart
Back to Central Park
Back to Central Park
