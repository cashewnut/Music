hey said us hustler's work is never through
We makin' it 'cause we make it move
The only thing we know how to do
Said it's the only thing we know how to do
Work hard, play hard

Keep partyin' like it's your job
Work hard, play hard
Work hard, play hard.

Keep partyin' like it's your job
Come on baby and drop this
Scrub that floor and just mop it
Show these gangsters how you cock block it
Don't care what you got in your pocket
I get the way that you rockin'
Flip that thang thang don't stop it
When I just bang bang and pop it
While the club crowded just watch you (work it out)
Got a gang of cash and it's all thrown out on the bar (now work it out)

And it's going fast cuz I feel like a superstar (now work it out)

And you may not have it, I might just broke the law (now work it out)

It's your time to grab it, now make this whole thing yours (now work it out)

Some pressure that we can push
Ladies can't get enough
Got my fitness, I'm looking buff
And all my people with me, I trust
Holdin' down for my suit k
If they askin' you, I'm not guilty
All the thing that I'm guilty of is making you rock with me (work it out)
